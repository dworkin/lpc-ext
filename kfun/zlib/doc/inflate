NAME
	inflate - decompress a string

SYNOPSIS
	string *inflate(varargs string str, int flag)


DESCRIPTION
	Decompress a string compressed with deflate compression. This function
	can only be called from a persistent object, and preserves state between
	calls.  It can be called repeatedly to keep adding compressed strings
	to the internal state, and returns an array of decompressed strings.
	The optional flag specifies whether the internal buffer should be
	flushed.
	To finish decompression, flush the internal buffer and discard the
	internal decompression state, call inflate() without arguments.
