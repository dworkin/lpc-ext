This package adds the following regular expression matching kfun to DGD, using
the DGD extension interface:

    regexp(pattern, str, case_insensitive, reverse)

For a description of the regular expression language accepted by this kfun,
please read doc-0.3/regexps.

To install, move regexp.c and libiberty into dgd/src, apply Makefile.diff to
dgd/src/Makefile, and fully recompile DGD.

This package is based on Robert Leslie's regular expression matching
package rgx-0.3.  The files in the directory libiberty were copied from
gdb-6.8, and are released under the GNU LGPL.  The file doc-0.3/regexps is
from rgx 0.3 (slightly modified by me), and was released under GPLv2.  All
other files are new with this release, and are released under GPLv3.
