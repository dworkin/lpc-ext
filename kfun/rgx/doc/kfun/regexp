NAME
	regexp - match a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
	int *regexp(string pattern, string str,
		    varargs int case_insensive, int reverse)

DESCRIPTION
	The argument str is matched against the regular expression pattern.
	If the argument case_insensitive is nonzero, the match is
	case-insensitive.  If the argument reverse is nonzero, matching is
	performed from right-to-left; otherwise, matching is performed
	left-to-right.
	If the argument str could not be matched with the regular expression,
	nil is returned.  Otherwise, an array is returned containing the
	offset in str of the first character of the match, followed by the
	offset in str of the last character of the match.  For any matched
	subexpressions, further pairs of offsets are appended to the array.
