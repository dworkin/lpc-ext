NAME
	tls_client - start a client TLS session

SYNOPSIS
	string tls_client(varargs string certificate, string key)


DESCRIPTION
	Start a client TLS session.  The optional arguments certificate and key
	are the paths of files, in PEM format, with the certificate chain and
	private key to use.  These path are relative to the configured
	directory of the TLS module.  The return value is the initial string
	to send to the server.
	The current object will be associated with the TLS session, and should
	not be destructed before tls_close() is called, or memory will leak.
