NAME
	gzip - compress a string

SYNOPSIS
	string *gzip(varargs string str, int mode)


DESCRIPTION
	Compress a string using gzip compression. This function can only be
	called from a persistent object, and preserves state between calls.
	It can be called repeatedly to keep adding strings to the compressed
	state, and returns an array of compressed strings.
	The optional mode argument is interpreted as the compression level in
	the first call (0 to 9, default is 6) and as a flag that specifies
	whether the internal buffer should be flushed in followup calls.
	To finish compression, flush the internal buffer and discard the
	internal compression state, call gzip() without arguments.
